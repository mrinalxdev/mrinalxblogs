      Understanding Taylor Series Convergence
    </h1>
    <span class="text-sm text-gray-500">9th July, 2025</span>

    <p class="font-serif mt-3 text-lg">
      The more research paper related to ML I read the more I see these topics
      out here, will try to explain everything I have ever learned or
      implemented through this.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif text-lg">
      Today we will talk about one of the most important questions (I have ever
      came across is) How do we prove that a taylor series actually converges to
      the function it's supposed to represent ??
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif text-lg">
      This isn't just academic curiosity for me but in machine learning taylor
      approximations constantly, from optimization algorithms to neural network
      activations. Understanding when and why these approximations work is
      important for you and me to learn build a well conditioned system.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-serif my-4">Basics first</h1>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif text-lg">
      <span class="font-bold">Taylor Series</span> is something that simplifies
      complex functions like \(sin(x)\) or taking exponential like \(e^x\) into
      a sum of simple polynomial terms (like \(x, x^2, x^3\) and so on).
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-3">
      In simple words this is like a single point on the function, like \(x=0 \)
      , and you want to describe the whole function just by knowing what’s
      happening right there. The Taylor series uses the function’s value, its
      slope (first derivative), its curvature (second derivative), and higher
      derivatives at that point to build a polynomial that mimics the function.
      The formula goes something like this. \[f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) +
      \frac{f''(a)}{2}(x - a)^2 + \frac{f'''(a)}{6}(x - a)^3 + \cdots\] If the
      point is a=0 , it’s called a Maclaurin series, so the Maclaurin series for
      \(e^x\) is \[e^x \approx 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{6} + \cdots\]
      Add more terms, and the polynomial gets closer to real \(e^x\), especially
      near \(x = 0\).
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-3">
      Does this polynomial, as you keep adding terms, actually become the
      function ?? <span class="font-bold">Convergence</span> describes whether
      the Taylor series actually equals the function as you add more terms. A
      series converges if the sum of its terms approaches the function’s value
      as the number of terms goes to infinity. The interval of convergence is
      the range of ( x )-values where this happens. ...
    </p>

    <ul class="ml-4 list-disc font-serif text-lg mt-3">
      <li>
        Some series, like the Taylor Series for \(e^x\), converges for all (x).
      </li>
      <li class="my-2">
        Others, like the series for \(ln(1 + x)\). only converge within a
        specific range (example : -1 < x ≤ 1)
      </li>
      <li class="my-2">
        The radius of convergence can often be found using the ratio test,
        checking the limit of the ratio of consecutive terms’ coefficients.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-3">
      This is what convergence looks like we have taken 6.0 as the x value so
      according to first rule it will converge.

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-3">
      Okay so coming back to our main question which is
    </p>

    <h1 class="font-serif text-2xl my-6">
      How Do We Determine Taylor Series Convergence?
    </h1>
    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-2">
      To determine if a Taylor series converges to the function, we need to
      check two things:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-decimal mt-3 font-serif ml-4 text-lg">
      <li>the series converges (i.e., the sum approaches a finite value)</li>
      <li class="my-2">
        the sum equals the function ( f(x) ). Convergence is often analyzed
        using the radius of convergence, and equality is verified using the
        remainder term.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="font-serif text-lg mt-3">
      The radius of convergence is found using the ratio test for the series
      <span class="text-xl">\(\sum a_n x^n\)</span>, where
      <span class="text-xl">\( a_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} \)</span>. If the
      limit
      <span class="text-xl"
        >\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \right| = L, \]</span
      >

      exists, the series converges for \( |x| < \frac{1}{L} \). If ( L = 0 ),
      the series converges for all (x).
    </p>

    <p class="font-serif text-lg mt-3">
      For \( e^x \), the series is
      <span class="text-xl">\( \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} \)</span>, so
      \( a_n = \frac{1}{n!} \). Compute the ratio: \[ \left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}
      \right| = \frac{\frac{1}{(n+1)!}}{\frac{1}{n!}} = \frac{n!}{(n+1)!} =
      \frac{1}{n+1} \to 0 \text{ as } n \to \infty. \] Since ( L = 0 ), the
      series converges for all ( x ). However, convergence alone isn’t enough—we
      need to ensure the sum equals \( e^x \).
    </p>

    <p class="font-serif text-lg mt-3">Moving onto our next question we have</p>

    <h1 class="font-serif text-2xl my-7">
      How Do We Prove the Taylor Series Equals the Function?
    </h1>

    <p class="font-serif text-lg mt-3">
      To prove the Taylor series equals the function, we use the remainder term.
      The ( n )-th partial sum of the Taylor series is: \[ s_n(x) =
      \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!} (x - a)^k. \]
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-3">
      The remainder is \( R_n(x) = f(x) - s_n(x) \). For the series to equal \(
      f(x) \), we need: \[ \lim_{n \to \infty} R_n(x) = 0. \] Lagrange’s form of
      the remainder is: \[ R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!} (x - a)^{n+1},
      \]
    </p>

    <p class="font-serif text-lg mt-3">
      where \( c \) is some point between \( a \) and \( x \). For \( e^x \) at
      \( a = 0 \) ==> \( f^{(n+1)}(x) = e^x \), so \( f^{(n+1)}(c) = e^c \). The
      remainder is: \[ R_n(x) = \frac{e^c}{(n+1)!} x^{n+1}, \] where \( c \) is
      between 0 and \( x \). Since \( e^c \leq e^{|x|} \) (as \( c \leq |x| \)),
      we have: \[ |R_n(x)| \leq \frac{e^{|x|}}{(n+1)!} |x|^{n+1}. \] As \( n \to
      \infty \), \( (n+1)! \) grows factorially, so \( |R_n(x)| \to 0 \) for any
      fixed \( x \). Thus, the series converges to \( e^x \).
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-serif my-4">
      Does the Approach Work for \( \sin(x) \) and \( \cos(x) \)?
    </h1>

    <p class="text-lg font-sherif mt-2">
      The approach applies to \( \sin(x) \) and \( \cos(x) \). Let’s derive the
      Maclaurin series for \( \sin(x) \):
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 font-serif text-lg mt-4">
      <li>\( f(x) = \sin(x) \), so \( f(0) = 0 \)</li>
      <li>\( f'(x) = \cos(x) \), so \( f'(0) = 1 \)</li>
      <li>\( f''(x) = -\sin(x) \), so \( f''(0) = 0 \)</li>
      <li>\( f'''(x) = -\cos(x) \), so \( f'''(0) = -1 \)</li>
      <li>
        The pattern alternates: \( f^{(n)}(0) = \sin(n\pi/2) \), giving 0, 1, 0,
        -1
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="font-serif text-lg mt-3">
      The series is \[ \sin(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n
      x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \cdots. \] For
      convergence, apply the ratio test to the non-zero terms
      <span class="text-xl">\( a_n = \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!} x^{2n+1} \)</span>:
      \[ \left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \right| = \frac{|x|^{2n+3} /
      (2n+3)!}{|x|^{2n+1} / (2n+1)!} = \frac{|x|^2}{(2n+3)(2n+2)} \to 0. \]
    </p>

    <p class="font-serif text-lg mt-3">
      The series converges for all \( x \). For the remainder, \( |f^{(n+1)}(c)|
      = |\sin(c)| \leq 1 \) or \( |\cos(c)| \leq 1 \), so: \[ |R_n(x)| \leq
      \frac{|x|^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \to 0. \] Similarly, for \( \cos(x) \), the
      series is: \[ \cos(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n}}{(2n)!},
      \] with the same convergence properties. Thus, both converge to their
      functions for all \( x \).
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-3">
      <span class="italic">Note the pattern</span> : \(e^x\), sin(x), and cos(x)
      all have the property that their derivatives don't grow too fast. For
      \(e^x\), the derivatives grow exponentially, but the factorial in the
      denominator grows even faster. For sin(x) and cos(x), the derivatives are
      bounded by 1.
      <br />
      Moving to our next question which you might have ...
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-serif my-6">When Taylor Series Fail</h1>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-3">
      Some functions have Taylor series that converge only within a limited
      interval or not to the function itself. For example, consider \( f(x) =
      \frac{1}{1+x^2} \). Its Maclaurin series is: \[ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n
      x^{2n}, \] which converges for \( |x| < 1 \) (by the ratio test). Outside
      this interval, the series diverges, unlike the function, which is defined
      for all \( x \).
    </p>

    <div class="my-10">
      <img src="./assets/fail.png" class="" alt="" />
      <p class="font-serif text-sm text-gray-500 text-center">
        The graph will clearly illustrate how the Maclaurin series approximates
        the function well within \( |x| < 1 \).
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-3">
      Another example is \( f(x) = e^{-1/x^2} \) for \( x \neq 0 \), and \( f(0)
      = 0 \). All derivatives at \( x = 0 \) are zero, so the Taylor series is
      identically zero, but \( f(x) \neq 0 \) for \( x \neq 0 \). Thus, the
      series doesn’t represent the function except at \( x = 0 \).
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-3">But</p>

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-serif my-6">
      How do we actually use these convergence proofs in practice?
    </h1>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-3">
      In neural networks, we often use activation functions like \( \tanh(x) \) or
      sigmoid functions. These can be computed using Taylor series, but there's
      a clever trick: instead of computing the series directly, we often use the
      fact that these functions satisfy simple differential equations. For
      instance, the sigmoid function \( \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} \) is
      related to \( \tanh(x) \) by \( \sigma(x) = \frac{1+\tanh(x/2)}{2} \). And \(
      \tanh(x) \) can be computed efficiently using its Taylor series, especially
      for small \( x \).
