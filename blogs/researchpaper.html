      Reading Research Papers 101
    </h1>
    <span class="text-sm text-gray-500">18th May, 2025</span>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-4">
      After reading white papers for a long peried, I have noticed that academic
      papers can hard to understand because of jargons and complex ideas, but
      they hold a lot of valuable information if we learn how to read to them.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 font-serif">
      Two papers which I haven't read
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-4">
      I get it, there are lots of research papers related to ai, backend,
      infrastructure coming out weekly. People posting I have read this paper,
      learned X Y Z and sometimes people (me) post that they have mimic the
      benchmarks and logic of the paper to build something out of it as a
      project and sometimes these projects can stand out from others and create
      a big difference.
    </p>

    <p class="font-serif text-lg mt-3">
      But now you are excited, searched for papers from perplexity, it showed a
      arivx paper, you installed the pdf of the paper. NOW WHATT !! you go
      through the paper understand nil about the topic nor did you get the
      abstract :((
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-2">
      I have nearly read 30 ~ 35 papers this year from papers having 5 pages to
      papers having 30+ pages, so thought to write a little bit on how to start
      reading :)) <br />
      Okkay first of all I want you to develop the ...
    </p>
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-serif mt-6">"Why am I reading this ?" habbit</h1>
    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-3">
      Always have this question before staring any paper. This may looks simple
      but it really matters on how are your learnings from this paper will go
      through. Defining the purpose sharpens our focus, saves time and esures we
      extract meaningful insights from the paper, whether it's 5 page or 100+
      page paper.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-2">
      Now you would have the question, How to even build this habbit ?? so here
      is my trick before opening the PDF, take 30 seconds to jot down your
      purpose. Be specific. Instead of “I want to learn AI,” try “I want to
      understand how this paper’s attention mechanism improves model efficiency
      for my chatbot project.” Revisit this why if you feel lost mid-paper, it’s
      our anchor.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-3">
      You have your paper installed, you got your "Why" now what ?? ...
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-serif mt-6">The Helicopter View</h1>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-2">
      Okkay starting with the second step, you need to know if the paper is
      really falling under your category of learning or the paper should be just
      surfed around.
      <span class="font-bold">What does surfed around means ??</span> for me I
      dont really read papers to gain core knowledge, sometimes I read different
      genre research papers to gain a general knowledge of different fields so
      that when time comes I can really brag about it in twitter spaces or
      meetups and gain some new friends who can really teach me more :))
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-2">
      So comming back to our topic what is even
      <span class="font-bold">Helicopter View</span> ?? .. its just skimming the
      whole paper or just the title and abstract and categorize the paper, for
      me I my categories are core learning (learning related to skillset I own
      for now), surfing(just to read and take small notes), time pass(nothing
      serious just reading it to make a habbit).
    </p>

      class="my-4"
      alt=""
    />

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-2">
      This step helps me decide if I should go all in for paper and complete the
      paper in 1 ~ 2 weeks digging deep around the topics of the paper or just
      chill with the paper
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-3">
      You have gone through the title and the abstract, it's a paper that
      attracts your interest for learning and diving deep into the topic. Now
      what ?? .. Read it anon
    </p>

    <h1 class="mt-6 font-serif text-3xl">Get the Hooks</h1>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-3">
      This is what I do with most of the papers I dig deep into, after skimming
      the paper once I note down these questions and try to answer it my self,
      <span class="font-bold">What are the main research question ?</span>,
      <span class="font-bold">What methods did they use ?</span>,
      <span class="font-bold">What are the main conclusions ?</span> getting
      some of the core details help me to finish the paper with more
      understanding in least amount time spent on it.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-2">
      Why does this work ? Answering these questions forces me to engage with
      the paper’s big picture before I get bogged down in details. For example,
      identifying the main research question tells me what problem the authors
      are tackling maybe it’s improving neural network efficiency or optimizing
      database queries. Knowing the methods (e.g., a novel algorithm or a
      specific dataset) gives me a sense of how they approached it, which is
      critical if I'm planning to replicate or build on their work. And the
      conclusions? They’re the payoff—what did the authors prove or discover?
      These hooks anchor my reading, so I'm not just passively scanning pages.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-2">
      This step also helps me decide my commitment level. Let’s say the paper’s
      research question aligns perfectly with my project, and the methods are
      something I can experiment with. That’s my signal to go deep—maybe spend a
      week reading related papers or coding a small prototype. On the flip side,
      if the conclusions are interesting but not directly relevant, I can chill,
      extract the key takeaways, and move on. I’ve saved hours by using these
      hooks to avoid over-investing in papers that sound cool but don’t serve my
      goals.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-serif mt-6">Eye to Eye with the paper</h1>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-3">
      Now, if I’ve decided to go all-in, it’s time to get eye to eye with the
      paper. When diving deep into the topics of research papers, I like to
      print a hard copy. There’s something about holding those pages that gives
      me a sense of responsibility to complete the paper. Replicating the system
      built by the authors give me a deeper knowledge of the methods and thier
      approach. I break the paper into sections and tackle them over a few days.
      For example, I’ll spend one session on the introduction and background to
      get the context, another on the methodology to understand the nuts and
      bolts, and a third on results and discussion to see what it all means.
      This paced approach prevents burnout and lets me absorb complex ideas. If
      the paper has code or datasets (check GitHub or the authors’ website!), I
      download them and start experimenting. Even a small replication like
      running their model on a toy dataset—can reveal insights that skimming
      never will.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-3">How do I even remember what I have read and implemented ?? ..</p>

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-serif mt-6">Teach someone about the paper</h1>

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-2">I tend to teach the learnings of my paper either to one of my best friend or record a video while explaining the paper deeply which also enhances my speaking part and expands my vocabulary</p>

    <img src="../blogs/assets/research-paper/rubber.png" class="mx-auto my-5 rounded-xl" alt="">

    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-3">Me explaining my best friend about the distributed system paper which I read. :))</p>

    <h1 class="text-xl font-serif mt-4">Something to note</h1>
    <p class="text-lg font-serif mt-2">Often times the writing structure of the paper is bad becuase sometimes English is the second language for the author. There maybe some grammatical mistakes or punctuation mistakes but the most important thing should be the outcome or the message from the paper. <br />
    after finishing the paper, I always drop my notes as a cold email to the authors gmail and send a thank you message from my side just as a token of appreciation :))</p>


    <p class="text-lg mt-3 font-serif">Hope I was able to add value to your today's learning goal !! Happy Learning ..</p>
