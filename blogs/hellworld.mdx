title: Build a custom memory allocator in go

Writing your own memory allocator in go is just stupid !! Go already has the best memory allocator and garbage collector . Why to re-write this from scratch ?

Well as someone who believes in `talk is cheap show me the code` kind of quotes, I am diving deep into building this stuff from scratch using golang.

### What is a Memory Allocator ?

In simple words it organizes and manages the computer's memory, giving out chunks to program when thek ask for it and taking them back when they're done, it keeps things smooth and chaos free for the computer to compute and execute the program.

## We are building this up !!

At first we should decide what out program should contain and plan our way out (this is my way ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è)

#### Focusing on the core functions

- Allocation `malloc` : Accepts a size request and returns a pointer to a momory block, to ensure the block is aligned to avoid performance panelaties or crashes
