Remember anon it all begins with a fundamental question `How do we describe change ?`

## Basics
Functions are the core concept for calculus $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, a mathematical relationship that associates each input value $x$ from its domain with exactly one output value $y$ in its codomain. We write this as $y=f(x)$. The beauty of functions lies in their ability to model real-world phenomenas like
- the height of a thrown ball at time $t$
- the population of algae after $h$ hours

Taking a simple quadratic function $f(x) = x^2$ simple algebric equations allows us to compute specefic values, whereas calculus asks deeper questions on `How rapidly is this function changing at any given point?` or `Area bounded by the curve`

## Derivatives
The idea of derivatives imerges from the attempt to precisely define rate of change of function. Zooming in on a curved line until it appears nearly straight. This leads to formal definition of the derivative:
> $$f(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$$

the derivative tells us not just where a function is but, where it is "going" - its velocity, its tendancy, its intantaneous behavious.

## Integration
If differentiation is about breaking things down, integration is about building them up. The definite integral :

$\int_a^b f(x)dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \Delta x$

This shows a how a function is affected over an interval, this could be the total distance traveled (intergrating velocity), total growth (integrating a rate), or area under a curve.
