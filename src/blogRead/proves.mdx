#### Q. Derive the formula for the derivative of the inverse sine function, i.e. find $\frac{d}{dx} (\sin^{-1}x)$

**Solution**: The inverse sine function, denoted by $\sin^{-1}x$ is defined as:

$$
y = \sin^{-1} x \iff \sin y = x
$$

Using implicit differentiation to differentiate with respect to $x$:

* Using implicit differentiation to differentiate with respect to $x$:
  $$\frac{d}{dx}(\sin y) = \frac{d}{dx} x$$

* Applying chain rule to the left-hand side:
  $$\cos y \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} = 1$$

* Solving $\frac{dy}{dx}$ we get:
  $$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{\cos y}$$

* Expressing $\cos y$ in terms of $x$ using Pythagorean theorem:
  $$\cos y = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2}$$

* Substituting the expression for $\cos y$ into the derivative, we get:
  $$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}$$

Hence proved: $$\boxed{\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}}$$

**We can Simplify even more**:

$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}{1 - x^2}
$$

### Prove that $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$

##### Proof: We use the Squeeze Theorem to prove this.

The **Squeeze Theorem** states:

If $f(x) \leq g(x) \leq h(x)$ for all $x$ in some interval around $a$ (except possibly at $a$ itself), and

$$ \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} h(x) = L, $$

then

$$ \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = L. $$

- Step 1: Define the inequality bounds

For $x \neq 0$, consider the unit circle. From geometry, we know:

$$ \cos x \leq \frac{\sin x}{x} \leq 1 \quad \text{for } x > 0 $$

- Step 2: Take the limit of the bounds as $x \to 0$

As $x \to 0$:

1. $\lim_{x \to 0} \cos x = 1$  
2. $\lim_{x \to 0} 1 = 1$

Thus, by the Squeeze Theorem: $$ \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1 $$

- Step 3: Justify using the geometric interpretation

Using the geometry of the unit circle:
- The length of the arc is $x$ (in radians).
- The vertical projection is $\sin x$.
- The horizontal projection gives $\cos x$.

By comparing the areas and relationships geometrically, the inequality holds.

#### Final Answer:

Thus, we have proved that: $$ \boxed{\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1} $$
